# This file is in the standard properties format ; i.e. a key and an associated
# value where the key declares the class name of an enumeration declaring a set 
# of enumerated values for each resource string present in the resource bundle 
# file. The Java code will access these resource strings throught the enumeration.
# Note that the enumeration must implement the IBundle marker interface.
# The value declares the prefix of the resource bundle files for the component.
